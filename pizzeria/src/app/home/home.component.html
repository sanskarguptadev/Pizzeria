          Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to pizzarelle, 
          which were kosher for Passover cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the synagogue
          on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads. Abba Eban
          has suggested that modern pizza "was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers
          added cheese and olive oil to matzah". Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day
          from the ancient Mediterranean world are focaccia (which may date back as far as the ancient
          Etruscans); Mankoucheh in Lebanon, coca (which has sweet and savory varieties) from Catalonia;
          Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in the Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna 
          part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include
          Chinese bing (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian 
          paratha (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian naan (leavened) and roti 
          (unleavened); the Sardinian carasau, spianata, guttiau, pistoccu; and Finnish rieska. Also worth
          noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat
          pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian flammkuchen, German 
          zwiebelkuchen, and French quiche.
